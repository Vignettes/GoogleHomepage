The Odin Project - Google Homepage

This is a project from the coursework for The Odin Project. The goal is to produce a website which resembles the Google search page stylistically. 

In creating this project I used several sources and YouTube videos for reference to better understand the usage of CSS styling. This current version uses grids and flexbox to achive the desired outcome.
